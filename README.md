## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Padding percentage is linked to the width of it's container, therefore using padding to determine height of image rather than using just the height property makes it easier to calculate the correct aspect ratio of the image
- Setting overflow property to none on the parent element will ensure that image and the color overlay do not spill over the border of the card component

### Continued development

- Use more complex properties of grid so that I can become friend with it
- Finding out different ways to add filter to an image

## Acknowledgments

Practice is a very important learning stage in coding, and I want to thank [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) for making it easier for me to do that. With their help, I can focus on understanding the different properties in HTML and CSS with my minimal knowledge on UI and UX design.
